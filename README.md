- 👋 Hi, I’m Milica Gacic.
- 🎧 Currently, I aim to become a QA tester.
- 👩🏻‍🎓 I’m pursuing a " Software testing (Manual + Automation) " course in the non-profit school opened in cooperation with Ana and Vlade Divac called " IT Bootcamp ".
- 👀 I’m interested in Software testing because I have an analytical mind and I enjoy looking deeply into everything, so naturally I enjoy looking for bugs. I'm also a very creative person so I can improve the quality of the product with some good brand new ideas.
- 📚 I learned java basics till now, but I will continue learning java and other languages because I'm enthusiastic about learning and developing my skills.
- ✍🏻 Outside of It world I am interested in learning to write with my left hand,I got inspiration and courage for that because I'm already using both hands while playing piano.
- 🎶 I really enjoy music,I like watching horror and sci-fi movies,I like reading self development books and I like traveling and meeting new cultures. Till covid 19 I had the opportunity to travel Europe. My two favorite cities are Barcelona and Tallinn, and my favorite country is Norway!
